# Enchanments
Possible enhancements to the consumer loan assistant project include:

➢ Many times, you know how much you can afford monthly and want to know how much you can
borrow. Add a capability to compute balance, given interest, months and payment. Follow
similar steps for computing the other parameters.

➢ Add single payment processing capability so you can see how much the balance decreases
each month and how much interest you are paying. Show results in the current text field or add
other controls.

➢ Add the capability to stop after a certain number of payments have been processed.

➢ Add printing capability to see a complete repayment schedule for any loan you design. 

➢ Add an output to the loan analysis that tells you what date your loan will be paid off based on
the number of monthly payments.
